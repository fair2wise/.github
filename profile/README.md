## üöÄ Project Overview

**FAIR to WISE** (From FAIR to WISE: Weaving Intelligent Scientific Ecosystems) is an effort to build an AI-augmented knowledge-graph platform that transforms raw scientific data and research publication into ‚Äúsmart data.‚Äù Focusing initially on organic photovoltaics (OPVs), we‚Äôll develop domain-specific ontologies, ingest and link literature and experimental results, and validate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows against traditional methods. The resulting RAG can be queried by an LLM to generate wise responses that are directly based on FAIR data, literature (with references) and experimental results.

## Repositories

**[FAIRtoWISE](https://github.com/fair2wise/FAIRtoWISE)**
	Core software library for orchestrating the data ingestion and "learning" workflows.

**[matkg](https://github.com/fair2wise/matkg)**
	Build KGs directly from source papers, with upper-level ontology support.

**[Material Science Ontologies](https://github.com/fair2wise/material_science_ontologies)**
	A collection of open-source, material science ontologies.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
