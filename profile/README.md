# FAIR to WISE

Weaving Intelligent Scientific Ecosystems at Berkeley Lab

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**FAIR to WISE** (From FAIR to WISE: Weaving Intelligent Scientific Ecosystems) is an effort to build an AI-augmented knowledge-graph platform that transforms raw scientific data and research publication into “smart data.” Focusing initially on organic photovoltaics (OPVs), we’ll develop domain-specific ontologies, ingest and link literature and experimental results, and validate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows against traditional methods. The resulting RAG can be queried by an LLM to generate wise responses that are directly based on FAIR data, literature (with references) and experimental results.
